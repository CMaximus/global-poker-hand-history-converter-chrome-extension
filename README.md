# global-poker-hand-history-converter-chrome-extension
This chrome extension enables you to download your Global Poker hand histories in the same format that Poker Stars uses for its hands for importing into Poker Tracker 4.

This repository holds the source code for the chrome extension. The source code for actually converting hand histories to poker stars lives [here](https://github.com/mr-feek/global-poker-hand-history-converter). Therefore, any issues regarding the actual conversion of hand histories should be opened up there.

## Installation

## Usage
Login to global poker and navigate to Profile > Hand History. You will see a new piece of UI inserted on the page which will enable you to download the converted hand histories.
